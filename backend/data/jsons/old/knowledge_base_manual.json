    "content": "Renting Out Your HDB Flat: Eligibility and Conditions.\n\nTo rent out your entire HDB flat, you must be a Singapore Citizen and have fulfilled the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of 5 years. The MOP ensures that HDB flats are primarily for owner-occupation. Before you can rent out your flat, you must obtain prior approval from HDB through the 'Application to Rent Out Whole Flat' e-Service. The maximum rental period per application is 3 years. Tenants must hold valid Singapore long-term passes, such as a Student Pass, Long-Term Social Visit Pass, or Work Permit, with a validity period of at least 6 months. Tourists are not allowed as tenants for HDB flats. There is also a Non-Citizen Quota for renting out the whole flat, which is currently set at 8% for neighbourhoods and 11% for blocks. This is to maintain a good ethnic mix in HDB estates. You must check the current quota for your block before proceeding."

    "content": "Regulations for Renting Private Residential Property in Singapore.\n\nUnlike HDB flats, there is no Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) for private residential properties like condominiums and landed houses. However, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) stipulates that the minimum rental period for any private residential unit is 3 consecutive months. Any lease shorter than this, such as for short-term holiday stays, is illegal. Furthermore, there is an occupancy cap to prevent overcrowding. The maximum number of unrelated occupants who can be housed in a private residential unit is six. This cap applies regardless of the size of the unit. The property owner is responsible for ensuring these regulations are met. It is not necessary to seek URA's approval before renting out a private property, but all tenancy agreements must comply with these rules."

    "content": "Key Clauses in a Singapore Tenancy Agreement (TA).\n\nA Tenancy Agreement is a legally binding contract between a landlord and a tenant. It should be in writing and clearly state all terms and conditions. Key clauses include: \n\n1. Diplomatic Clause: This is crucial for expatriate tenants. It allows the tenant to terminate the lease after 12 months by giving 2 months' notice if they are transferred out of Singapore or lose their job. This clause typically only applies to leases longer than one year. \n\n2. Security Deposit: This is usually one month's rent for a one-year lease, or two months' rent for a two-year lease. The TA must specify the conditions under which the landlord can deduct from the deposit (e.g., for damages beyond normal wear and tear) and when it must be returned, which is typically within 14 days after the lease ends. \n\n3. Repair and Maintenance Clause: This clause outlines who is responsible for repairs. Typically, the tenant is responsible for minor repairs up to a certain amount (e.g., $150-$200), while the landlord is responsible for major repairs, such as issues with the structure, wiring, or major appliances provided with the unit. \n\n4. Stamp Duty: It is mandatory for a Tenancy Agreement to be stamped by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) to be valid in court. The cost is borne by the tenant."

    "content": "General Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants.\n\nLandlord's Responsibilities: The primary responsibility of the landlord is to ensure the property is in a tenantable and habitable condition at the start of the lease. This includes ensuring all provided appliances are in good working order and that the property is clean. The landlord must also respect the tenant's right to quiet enjoyment of the property, meaning they cannot enter the premises without giving prior notice (usually 24 hours), except in emergencies. The landlord is also responsible for paying property tax.\n\nTenant's Responsibilities: The tenant must pay rent on time, as stipulated in the agreement. They are expected to maintain the property in a clean and good condition, allowing for reasonable wear and tear. The tenant must not use the property for any illegal purposes and must not cause a nuisance to neighbours. Any minor repairs, as defined in the TA, are the tenant's responsibility. At the end of the lease, the property should be returned in the same condition it was received, aside from fair wear and tear."

    "source": "Manual Guide - Dispute Resolution",
    "content": "Resolving Disputes between Landlords and Tenants.\n\nIf a dispute arises that cannot be resolved amicably, parties should first refer to the Tenancy Agreement, which is the governing document. If the issue persists, they can seek mediation. The Community Mediation Centre (CMC) provides mediation services for landlord-tenant disputes. For claims not exceeding $20,000, parties can file a claim with the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT). The SCT provides a quick and affordable way to resolve disputes without needing a lawyer. It's important to note that the SCT can only hear cases where the lease is for a residential property and for a term not exceeding two years. For larger claims or more complex legal issues, parties may need to seek legal advice and pursue the matter in the civil courts."
