The quota is to help maintain a good ethnic mix in HDB estates. Malaysians are not subject to this quota in view of their close cultural and historical similarities with Singaporeans. The quota is set at 8% at the neighbourhood level and 11% at the block level, and applicable if any tenant renting the flat is a non-Malaysian non-citizen. If the quota is reached, only Singaporeans and Malaysians can rent a flat in that neighbourhood/ block. This quota does not apply to the renting out of bedrooms.

The consequences can be directed at both tenant and Landlord, so it’s better to just pay up. Ideally, the tenant should send a receipt of the stamp duty payment to their Landlord. But in cases where this doesn’t happen, Landlords who are unsure of whether their tenant has paid the stamp duty can log on to the IRAS website to check.
